# Google Play Store Analysis

Welcome to the **Google Play Store Analysis** repository! This project provides a deep dive into the rich dataset of apps available on the Google Play Store. The analysis covers a variety of aspects including app ratings, installations, categories, and more. By leveraging data cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques, this project aims to uncover key insights and trends within the mobile app market.

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into several key components:

### Dataset

- **[googleplaystore.csv](./googleplaystore.csv):**  
  This is the original dataset containing information on thousands of apps from the Google Play Store. It includes attributes such as app name, category, rating, number of installs, size, price, and more. This raw data serves as the foundation for all subsequent analysis.

### Data Analysis & Cleaning

- **[analyse.ipynb](./analyse.ipynb):**  
  This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to the exploration and visualization of the dataset. The notebook includes:
  - **Data Cleaning:** Steps to prepare the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, ensuring the analysis is based on accurate and reliable data.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed examination of the dataset to reveal patterns, relationships, and trends among the different app attributes.
  - **Visualizations:** A variety of charts and graphs to help visualize the insights gained from the data.

### Processed Data

- **[cleaned_googleplaystore.csv](./cleaned_googleplaystore.csv):**  
  This file contains the cleaned and processed version of the dataset, which has been refined to remove noise and prepare it for further analysis and visualization.

### Interactive Dashboard

- **[app.py](./app.py):**  
  A Dash-based web application that showcases the visualizations derived from the Google Play Store data. The app is designed to be both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, providing an interactive way to explore the data.

## Features
